📝 A Challenge Question (covers up to Chapter 5 of modern TkDocs)
Here’s a question that forces you to use all the tkinter concepts I’ve learned so far (21-11-2025):

## Design a simple “User Registration Form” in Tkinter that includes:

- A Frame to organize the layout

- Labels and Entry widgets for name, email, and password

- A Checkbutton for “Subscribe to newsletter”

- A set of Radiobuttons for selecting gender (Male/Female/Other)

- A Combobox for choosing country from a predefined list

- A Button that validates the inputs and prints them when clicked

- Use the Grid Geometry Manager to align everything neatly in rows and columns
